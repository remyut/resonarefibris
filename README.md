#WELCOME TO MY PUBLIC REPOSITORY
================================

I am Remy Saksik I am developing a real time Android acoustic application applied to music theory as a hobby.

The main feature of this project is working in an accurate way, I will be glad to give you a demo to prove the well working condition of the code.

I am actively applying for mobile development position worldwide.

This development is also used to show the skills I acquired in Android to recruiters. 

I am for now the only contributor, this project is hosted on a private repository.

I will allow the technical recruiters to have access to the code.

In order to access it, request access by sending me an email to: saksik.remy@gmail.com

**Note: You need a valid GitHub account to access the private repository**

I am sharing with you the project's roadmap and the concepts used.


#Roadmap
========
* Get the official Android google training (150 USD) 
* Optimise FFT calculation using native C (NDK)
* Implement music prediction using machine learning
* Publish the App on the Playstore by 2019
